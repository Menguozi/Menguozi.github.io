## RRCS 

* **A Bandwidth-efficient Scheme for Mitigating the Side Channel Attacks in Cloud Storage Services**
* Deduplication is able to effectively identify and eliminate redundant data and only maintain a single copy of files and chunks. Hence, it is widely used in cloud storage systems to save storage space and network bandwidth. However, the occurrence of deduplication can be easily identified by monitoring and analyzing network traffic, which leads to the risk of users' privacy leakage. Deduplication can be used as a side channel to reveal privacy information of users. In order to address this problem, we propose an easy-to-use and bandwidth-efficient scheme, called randomized redundant chunk scheme (RRCS), to mitigate the risk of side channel attacks while maintaining the high bandwidth efficiency of deduplication. By carefully adding randomly chosen redundant chunks for each uploaded file, RRCS can mix up the real deduplication states of files and effectively obfuscate the view of the attacker, who attempts to exploit the amount of the transmitted data for side channel attacks. Our security analysis shows that RRCS could significantly mitigate the risk of the side channel attacks. We implement the RRCS prototype and evaluate it by using three large-scale real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that RRCS delivers high performance while providing security guarantee.
 

## SmartSA
* **SmartSA: An Energy-aware Image Sharing System for Real-time Situation Awareness in Disasters**
* Smartphones have been widely used to share images and provide concrete information in disaster areas. However, due to the limited bandwidth and energy availability, conventional smartphone-based image sharing fails to efficiently meet the real-time requirement for situation awareness information. In order to efficiently improve the efficiency of image sharing, we propose SmartSA, an energy-aware image sharing system that can significantly decrease the consumption of bandwidth and energy.
As a salient feature, the SmartSA system adaptively adjusts its behavior to save energy and meanwhile exploits the available amounts of physical energy to guide such system adaptation, thus saving energy and extending battery life. We have implemented the real SmartSA prototype. Extensive experimental results, using real-world datasets, demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of SmartSA.
