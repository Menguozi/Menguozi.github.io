>## 1. Reduce log-structure write amplification
   
### Overview

<!-- Memory disaggregation, which has attracted extensive attentions from both industry, e.g., HPâ€™s The Machine and Intel RSD and academia, decouples the traditional monolithic compute and memory resources in datacenters and forms independent compute and memory resource pools. Due to resource pooling and independent hardware deployments, disaggregated memory enjoys the benefits of improvements on resource utilization, failure isolation, and elasticity. In the disaggregated memory architecture, compute blades run applications with only a small amount of memory as cache. In contrast, the memory pool stores application data with weak computing power. Due to not involving the compute resources in the memory pool, fast one-sided RDMA networks generally serve for data accesses from the compute blades to the memory pool. -->
