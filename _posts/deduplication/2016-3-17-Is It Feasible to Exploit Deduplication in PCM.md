Title: Is it feasible to exploit deduplication in PCM ?
comments: true
categories: Deduplication PCM

I recently have an idea about exploiting deduplication in PCM, and thus search the realted work on deduplication in PCM. As a result, I only find one paper about deduplication in PCM. This paper is "How to Improve the Space Utilization of Dedup-based PCM Storage Devices?" published in CODES+ISSS 2015. In the following, I briefly describe the content of this paper and present my comments.
